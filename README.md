# Housing Price Prediction Modelling

This repository contains the dataset and models used for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains details of residential properties in Ames, Iowa, and the goal is to predict the sale prices of homes based on various features.

### Dataset Files:

The following files are included in this repository:

1. **data_description.txt**  
   Contains descriptions for each column/feature in the dataset.

2. **sample_submission.csv**  
   A sample submission file showing how to format predictions for submission to Kaggle.

3. **test.csv**  
   The test set (features only, no target variable). This file is used for making predictions.

4. **train.csv**  
   The training set, which contains both features and the target variable (`SalePrice`). This is used to train your model.
